HTTPS Tunnel Overview
=====================

HTTPS Tunnel is a tunnel through HTTP / HTTPS connection. You can run HTTPS
Tunnel along with a standard HTTP server (Nginx, Apache, Lighttpd, etc) or a
load balancer. It can be activated with certain URIs.

Connecting Process
------------------

The default URIs, which can be configured manually, for HTTPS Tunnel are:

    Gateway:       /ht/login.php
    Data tranport: /ht/file.php

Implementation does not require data transport be on the same host with gateway.

First, the client sends a POST request to /ht/login.php with authenciation
request.

The server returns a 302 response with a session ID to redirect the user to the
data transpot URI at /ht/file.php.

Then the client sends /ht/file.php a connection request, returning a
connection ID.

Then the client opens at least two connections to /ht/file.php, called
transport pipes, one for upload, one for download.

Shutting down a connection requires a shutdown request to /ht/file.php, or it
happens when no transport pipes are active for a certain time, usually 180
seconds.
