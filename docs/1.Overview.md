HTTPS Tunnel Overview
=====================

HTTPS Tunnel is a HTTPS multiplexer. It can work along with a traditional HTTPS
server or load balancer. It can be also configured to work behind nginx or
squid and be triggered with certain URIs or parameters.

Connecting Process
------------------

The default URIs, which can be configured manually, for HTTPS Tunnel are:

    Gateway:       /ht/gate
    Data tranport: /ht/data

Implementation does not require data transport be on the same host with gateway.

First, the client sends a POST request to /ht/gate with authenciation request.

The server returns a 302 response with a session ID to redirect the user to the
data transpot URI at /ht/data.

Then the client sends /ht/data a connection request, returning a connection ID.

Then the client opens at least two connections to /ht/data, called transport
pipes, one for upload, one for download.

Shutting down a connection requires a shutdown request to /ht/data, or it
happens when no transport pipes are active for a certain time, usually 180
seconds.
